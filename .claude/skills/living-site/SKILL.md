# Living Site

A normal website sits still. A living site has three layers that each move for a reason:

| Level | What it is | Made with | It must... |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Live 3D | One showpiece object you can play with | Spline | react to the visitor, never trap the scroll |
| 2. Film and images | A scroll film plus stills from the same world | Higgsfield (Nano Banana 2 + Seedance 2.0) | be one continuous shot, no cuts, crisp at 2x |
| 3. Living motion graphics | Diagrams that explain the product and never stop breathing | Claude, in code | tell a story on a loop, in the Claude motion language |

The page around them is a faithful copy of a site that is already beautiful. You do not invent a layout.
You borrow a great one and make the three levels the reason it feels new.

Work through the five stages in order. Each has a gate. Do not skip a gate.

> **KOSIF:** read `KOSIF.md` first. It maps the CLI tools to the Higgsfield MCP, mirrors the page laws for
> Arabic RTL, and adds `check.py --levels` for honest partial builds.

## Stage 0. Setup (one block)

For work that needs AI images or video, check whether Higgsfield is already connected.
If that is unclear, ask once: "Have you already got Higgsfield set up for image and video generation?"
If they need to set it up, point them to higgsfield.ai (no referral links).
If they are already connected, use their existing setup (in KOSIF sessions the Higgsfield MCP is usually
connected: see KOSIF.md for the tool mapping). Users use their own account; generation may use credits. Confirm the credit plan before generating.

```bash
L=~/.claude/skills/living-site
export WORKDIR=~/sites/<brand>            # one folder per site; the credit ledger lives here
mkdir -p "$WORKDIR"/{refs,kf,film,img,loops,vendor}
cp $L/runtime/*.js "$WORKDIR/vendor/"
higgsfield account status < /dev/null      # logged in? credits?
command -v ffmpeg python3 node >/dev/null && python3 -c "import numpy, PIL" && echo tools-ok
[ -d $L/tools/node_modules ] || (cd $L/tools && npm install)   # puppeteer-core, for headless screenshots
```

Spline: the Spline MCP must be connected for Level 1 builds (Pro plan = 200 tool calls a day, resets 00:00 UTC).
Count your calls. A full custom scene costs about 6 to 10.

Serve the folder in the background, never in the foreground:
`nohup python3 -m http.server <port> --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory "$WORKDIR" >/dev/null 2>&1 &`

## Stage 1. Pick a real site and copy it (the canvas)

1. Browse a gallery of real sites (styles.refero.design, Mobbin, Savee). Pick one that is calm, confident and
   has big type and big images. Mercury, Apple product pages, Raycast and AuthKit all worked.
2. Capture it: hero, every section, colours, fonts, radii, spacing. Write the system down in `design.md`
   (exact hexes, font and weights, type scale, radius, button shape).
3. Copy it faithfully: same section order, same spacing rhythm, same components. Only the brand, words and
   media change. A faithful copy of a great site beats an original mediocre one every time.

Page laws (they came from real feedback, read `references/page-laws.md`):
- **One page, one thought.** Each section says one thing. Short headings. Little body copy.
- **The order:** showstopping 3D at the top, then the scroll film as its own section, then stills through the page,
  then a living motion graphic, then a calm closing call to action.
- **Split, do not stack.** Copy on the left, the visual on the right. Never put text over busy footage.
- **No hard edges.** Sections fade into each other with gradients. No straight lines between worlds.
- **Readable type.** One strong display face (Inter Tight, Inter at 480 to 600, or the reference's own) at -0.03em.
- **Real logos only.** Simple Icons or the brand's own files. A fictional brand gets one footer line saying so.

Gate: `design.md` exists and the empty page already looks like the reference with grey boxes in place of media.

---

## Stage 2. Level 1: the live 3D

Read `references/level-1-3d.md` before you start. The short version:

- **One 3D showpiece per site, two at most.** Plus tiny details if they earn it. Do not go crazy.
- **What wins:** characters and brand marks, big and full screen (a robot hero, a particle logo that forms where the
  cursor stops, a pressable key). **What loses:** abstract props that "don't add much" (a glass orb), and
  anything glassy or juicy rendered small (it reads low-res).
- **Three ways to get it:**
  1. Build your own with the Spline MCP. Full control, exportable, can talk to the page.
  2. Embed a community scene. Open the community page, read the iframe inside it: its
     `app.spline.design/file/<inner-id>?view=preview` link is public. (The id in the community URL is not.)
     Credit the author in the footer.
  3. Remix a community scene into your account, then export it like your own.
- **Never trap the scroll.** Put a clear shield over every iframe. For your own scenes the shield passes the cursor
  in by `postMessage` (runtime/spline-shield.js + the bridge snippet in the reference). Community scenes run on
  their own behind the shield. No "click to play" pills, no "move your cursor" hints.
- Crop editor chrome by oversizing the iframe; fade the bottom with a mask so the model melts into the page.

Gate: the 3D loads, reacts (or animates), the wheel always scrolls the page, and nothing overlays it.

## Stage 3. Level 2: Higgsfield film and images (the co-star)

Read `references/level-2-higgsfield.md`. This is where most of the "how did they do that" comes from.

1. **Pick one camera move for the whole film.** Push in (ridge, then desk, then into the laptop screen),
   pull back (a robot's visor, then the whole room), or morph through time (cave wall, typewriter, keyboard,
   voice). One move. Never a slideshow of scenes.
2. **Make 3 to 5 keyframes as a chain** with `tools/gen_image.sh`. Keyframe N+1 uses keyframe N as its
   reference. Same camera direction, same light, one change per step. Look at a contact sheet. Remake any
   keyframe that turns the camera or changes the room. A remake costs 2 credits; a cut clip costs 60.
3. **Write one prompt per clip** in `film/prompts.txt`, each starting "One continuous single shot, no cuts."
4. **Render:** `zsh $L/tools/film_chain.sh "$WORKDIR" 1080p 5`. Seedance 2.0, both ends pinned, each clip starts
   on the previous clip's exact last frame, audio off. It scans for hidden cuts, joins, writes `frames/` and
   runs the continuity gate. If a clip cuts: remake the END keyframe from the previous clip's last frame
   (same angle), delete that clip, rerun. Never hide a cut with a fade.
5. **End the film on the thing the next section shows live.** The laptop screen shows an orb, then the live 3D
   orb is waiting below. The film hands over to Level 1.
6. **Stills from the same world:** pass the film keyframes as references so cards match the film.
7. **Living stills:** `tools/living_loop.sh` turns a Seedance start=end loop into a seamless forward-and-back loop.
   Use them for product cards. They make a static grid feel alive.

Show the film with `recipes/split-film.html` (captions left, framed film right, frame blending on).

Gate: cut scan clean, continuity PASS, film plays smoothly at slow scroll, ledger total matches the quote.

## Stage 4. Level 3: living Claude motion graphics

Read `references/level-3-motion.md`. Every site gets at least one. They are what make the page feel alive
when nobody is touching it.

- **A Level 3 piece explains the product.** Voice becomes a prompt that lands in Claude Code. A fruit rides a
  line into a bottle. A day dial ticks off a robot's jobs. If it could sit on any site, it is decoration. Cut it.
- **The Claude motion language:** soft cards, wires that draw themselves, a packet that rides the wire, the node
  pulses when it lands, a tick draws itself, then the next round. White dot-grid island (#FFF, 38 px dots,
  navy ink, one accent) inside a darker page looks premium. The real Claude spark only where Claude is truly
  part of the story.
- **It starts empty and builds in once** at 30% visible, then loops forever, pauses off screen, and shows the
  finished still for reduced motion or the Off switch.
- Start from `recipes/living-pipeline.js`, then give each node its own beat (`onArrive`).

The recipe shelf (`recipes/`), all tested on real builds:

| Recipe | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `living-pipeline.js` | Any "how it works" flow. The Level 3 workhorse. |
| `split-film.html` | The Level 2 film, framed, with word-by-word captions. |
| `word-light.js` | One full-screen sentence that lights up word by word on scroll. |
| `eclipse-cta.html` | A dark closing CTA: a star fades, an eclipse blooms behind the headline. |
| `led-eyes.js` | A wall of LED dots with two eyes that follow the cursor (robots, assistants). |
| `live-counters.js` | Sliders that drive counting numbers and a filling bar (pricing, savings). |
| `reveal.css` + `reveal.js` | The soft arrival for every heading, card and button. |

Gate: something visibly changes every 1 to 2 s in every Level 3 piece; at most 6 words inside it; zero console errors.

## Stage 5. Copy, check, show

1. **Copy:** short, specific, human. No em or en dashes. No invented numbers. If a SlopMonster-style linter is
   installed, run it to 5/5. Otherwise apply `references/copy.md` by hand.
2. **Check:** `python3 $L/check.py "$WORKDIR/index.html"` must print PASS. It checks the three levels are present,
   motion respects reduced motion, no scroll traps, no raw scroll listeners, assets exist, no dashes in copy.
3. **Look:** headless screenshots at 1440x900 and 390x844 with `tools/shots.js` (two shots a second apart prove it
   moves). Read every image. Fix the worst three things. Repeat until it looks like the reference on a great day.
4. **Report:** the URL, one line per level (what it is, how it moves), credits spent, Spline calls used, open gaps.

## Guardrails
- Confirm the credit plan before spending. Log every credit in `ledger.tsv`. Stop and ask when credits or
  Spline calls run out.
- Never ship a cut, a stuck scroll, a placeholder grey box, or a fake logo.
- Never edit someone else's Spline file. Embed it or remix it.
- Leave no servers or headless browsers running.
